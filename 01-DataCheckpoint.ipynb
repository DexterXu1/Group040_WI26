    "It's so common for college students to choose to drop their courses within the beginning few weeks of a new quarter, that we often overlook the significance behind this behavior: what factors could actually be correlated with this complex decision - giving up a course that is planned or even anticipated for months since registration? Specifically, aside from non-academic reasons, what aspects of a course itself may be associated with a high withdrawal rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "One previous research has been conducted on the affective reasoning of why students might choose to withdraw courses.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Among the multiple reasons for dropping from a course, \"at risk of failing the course\" is ranked at the top with a 39.9% probability of withdrawing. In other words, students may tend to drop courses if they feel they may get bad grades, mainly due to the difficulty, as the courses continue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another research has pointed out that \"assignment too heavy\" could be a reason of dropping courses as well.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) This term, first of all, may be regarded as an implication of the difficulty of the course. However, this research was conducted through community colleges, and academic workload is related to job conflict (time conflict) specifically in this case. Therefore, heavy assignments also represent time consuming tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also discovered a prior study that takes the teaching quality into account.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) By examining SRT (students rating of teaching) data, the researchers show that students can have their own evaluations of the instructors only after taking a few classes, which is then a critical factor of if the students will drop the course. Noteworthy, this factor is isolated from the probability of receiving bad grades or being assigned heavy tasks, because teaching methods or attitudes of professors do not necessarily relate to their assignments or rating scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawing on the findings of the researches above, we include three major instructional factors - average course grades, course workload (work time), and instructor ratings - in our research of their correlations to the students' dropping rate of COGS courses at UCSD, examining if they show the same correlations in our case as well.\n",

    "We predict that there is likely a strong correlation between COGS course drop rate at UCSD and students' evaluations.

    "### Data overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"ideal\" dataset that we would be looking for should contain information like instructor ratings, average course grades, number of students enrolled, and a measurement of their workload. Variables like average grade and instructor ratings will be continuous, along with discrete variables such as the amount of students enrolled, and what course they are enrolled in. We will be looking at data from the 2022 Fall quarter to 2023 Spring quarter via CAPE evaluations which are publically available. The data would be stored in a table grouped by the course id / course name, and for each of these we would have data containing the average grades received, instructor recommending rates, course workloads, and drop rates. Some datasets that already exist include CAPE Evals. These are stored as URLs, and are publically available to everyone. Another public student made dataset exists in Github, containing data recorded from webreg, which include the times at which students dropped or enrolled in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset #1\n",
    "  - Name: capes_data.csv\n",
    "  - Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanbornpnguyen/ucsdcapes\n",
    "  - Number of observations: 63363 (raw)\n",
    "  - Number of variables: 11 (raw)\n",
    "  - Variables most relevant to the project: we will be focusing on the variables \"Percentage Recommended Professor\", \"Study Hours per Week\", and \"Average Grade Received\". The \"Percentage Recommended Professor\" is a percentage that stands for what proportion of the CAPEs would recommend the professor (not the course itself), which is the instructor rating. The \"Studys Hours per Week\" gives float data to two decimal places on the average study hours per week among the CAPEs, in other words, the workload. The \"Average Grade Received\" variable is for the actual average grade that the CAPEs received on this course, both in the form of letter grade and a more detailed two decimal place GPA out of 4. Only the selected courses will be analyzed (COGS 1, 14A, 17, 101B, 107A).\n",
    "  - Shortcomings: It must be admitted that not everyone enrolled in the course responded on the CAPE, which may cause the dataset less representative to the actual entire course situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "- Dataset #2\n",
    "  - Name:\n",
    "  - Link: https://github.com/UCSD-Historical-Enrollment-Data/UCSDHistEnrollData\n",
    "  - Number of observations:\n",
    "  - Number of variables: 5 (raw)\n",
    "  - Variables most relevant to the project: we will mostly be focusing on the variable \"enrolled\" and \"waitlisted\". \"Enrolled\" displays integer numbers of the currently enrolled number of people to the course over time. \"Waitlisted\" displays the integer numbers of the currently waitlisted number of people to the course over time. We will monitor their changes from the beginning of the quarter to the end of week 4 - when the \"drop\" action ends. Everytime the \"waitlisted\" number decreases by 1 from the beginning of instruction to the end of week 2 (the last day of waitlist), we count it as 1 person dropping, because that's when waitlist automatically fills the enrollment in once a spot is available. From week 3 to the end of week 4, everytime the \"enrolled\" number decreases by 1, we count it as 1 person dropping, because waitlist has already ended and people only drop out from the course.\n",
    "  - Shortcomings: Since the dataset only provides the changes of enrollment and waitlist number over the time, but not directly showing when the \"drop\" action happens, we can only infer drop data from the changes of enrollment and waitlist, which may not be too precise. We need to assume that most of people stay on the waitlist for the first two weeks."

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
